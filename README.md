Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans-+Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, method and principles for developing and implementation of software systems. 
2-- Software engineering is crucial in technology of today because it facilitate the creation of applications and systems that power various aspects of technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANS-- The creation of FORTRQN and C 
 Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
 The rise of agile Methodology in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS--Requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.

from requirements is the gathering of all necessary information and system requirements to for a particular software product, then design is the creation of high-level designs of software architecture and user interface, implementation is the writing of codes and building systems according to specifications, then testing is conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards and deployment is the release of applications for users and customer then maintenance is the constant edit and debugging of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS--waterfall Methodology is the sequential process with distinct phases from up to down like writing a program that search for a particular name in a set of list, while, the agile is the iteractive and incremental approach focused on flexibility and it easily responds to changes like a program that is capable of adding different set of numbers whether double or numerous. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer arw people who writes codes and implementing software applications 
assurance engineer designs and conduct test to ensure the software meets specified quality 
project manager are supervisors of the planning, implementation and to the deployment 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDES-- is used for writing of code and editing of codes eh vs codes 
VCS-- is used for tracking update in source codes and coordinating among team members eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
technical debt 
changing requirements 
tight deadlines
to avoid this there must be;
prompt actiont
effecting communication 
use of agile methodologies 

Explain the different types of testingl(unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test- is the test of a single module of a software
integration test - testing iteration of different components or subsystem 
system test- is the testing of the whole system 
acceptance - this is the testing of software against user requirements 
  it helps identify and fix problems during development process 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
prompt engineering is the proper crafting of question in order to get a desired response from an AI model


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- what is a flower
improved prompt- what does a hibiscus flower in sub Saharan African look like
